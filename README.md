# vue-input-image

Just call this component, pick a image, then a @submit event will dispatch returning a BASE64 String.

Mandatory peer dependencies:

- Vue 2.0
- Vue-loader
- Buefy (also must call in Vue.use())
- Bulma (CSS framework)
- A ES6 blunder
- Browser support for 'FileReader' API

Most-likely you want to use this along with 'vue webpack template' (vue init webpack)
